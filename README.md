# Android challenge
We would like to learn more about how you approach a challenge as an Android Engineer.
There is a simple app that isn’t made with best practices in mind and works perfectly in the happy path.

The challenge will be composed of a pair programming session, where we are going to improve and fix some issues with an application that has a simple requirement:

```
As a potential traveler, I want to be able to fetch reviews for one of our most popular Berlin tours.
```

We’ll evaluate platform, architecture, testing, and problem solving-knowledge.

What you’ll need:
- Java 21 and Android Studio configured
